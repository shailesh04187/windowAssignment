<h1>What is JavaScript ?</h1>
<p>JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language. 
It is lightweight and most commonly used as a part of web pages,
 whose implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages. 
It is an interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities.</p>

<p>JavaScript was first known as LiveScript, but Netscape changed its name to JavaScript, 
possibly because of the excitement being generated by Java. 
JavaScript made its first appearance in Netscape 2.0 in 1995 with the name LiveScript.
 The general-purpose core of the language has been embedded in Netscape, Internet Explorer, and other web browsers.</p>

<p>The ECMA-262 Specification defined a standard version of the core JavaScript language.</p>

<p>.JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language.</p>
<p>.Designed for creating network-centric applications.</p>
<p>.Complementary to and integrated with Java.</p>
<p>.Open and cross-platform.</p>

<h1>Client-Side JavaScript</h1>
<p>Client-side JavaScript is the most common form of the language.
 The script should be included in or referenced by an HTML document for the code to be interpreted by the browser.

It means that a web page need not be a static HTML, but can include programs that interact with the user,
 control the browser, and dynamically create HTML content.

The JavaScript client-side mechanism provides many advantages over traditional CGI server-side scripts.
 For example, you might use JavaScript to check if the user has entered a valid e-mail address in a form field.

The JavaScript code is executed when the user submits the form, and only if all the entries are valid,
 they would be submitted to the Web Server.

JavaScript can be used to trap user-initiated events such as button clicks, link navigation, 
and other actions that the user initiates explicitly or implicitly.</p>


<h1>Advantages of JavaScript</h1>
<p>The merits of using JavaScript are −</p>

<b>Less server interaction −</b> <p>You can validate user input before sending the page off to the server.
This saves server traffic, which means less load on your server. </p>

<b>Immediate feedback to the visitors − </b> <p>They don't have to wait for a page reload to 
see if they have forgotten to enter something. </p>

<b>Increased interactivity −</b> <p> You can create interfaces that react when the user hovers over 
them with a mouse or activates them via the keyboard. </p>

<b>Richer interfaces −</b> <p>You can use JavaScript to include such items as drag-and-drop components and
 sliders to give a Rich Interface to your site  </p>


<h1>Limitations of JavaScript</h1>
<p>We cannot treat JavaScript as a full-fledged programming language. It lacks the following important features −</p>

<p>.Client-side JavaScript does not allow the reading or writing of files. This has been kept for security reason.</p>

<p>.JavaScript cannot be used for networking applications because there is no such support available.</p>

<p>.JavaScript doesn't have any multi-threading or multiprocessor capabilities.</p>

<p>Once again, JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language that allows you to build interactivity into otherwise static HTML pages.</p>


<h1>JavaScript Development Tools</h1>
<p>One of major strengths of JavaScript is that it does not require expensive development tools. 
You can start with a simple text editor such as Notepad. Since it is an interpreted language inside the context of a web browser,
 you don't even need to buy a compiler.</p>

<p>To make our life simpler, various vendors have come up with very nice JavaScript editing tools. Some of them are listed here −</p>

<b>.Microsoft FrontPage</b> −</b><p> Microsoft has developed a popular HTML editor called FrontPage.
 FrontPage also provides web developers with a number of JavaScript tools to assist in the creation of interactive websites.</p>

<b>.Macromedia Dreamweaver MX − </b> <p>Macromedia Dreamweaver MX is a very popular HTML and JavaScript editor in the professional web development crowd.
 It provides several handy prebuilt JavaScript components, integrates well with databases, and conforms to new standards such as XHTML and XML.</p>

<b>.Macromedia HomeSite 5 − </b> <p>HomeSite 5 is a well-liked HTML and JavaScript editor from Macromedia that can be used to manage personal websites effectively.</p>



<h1>Where is JavaScript Today ?</h1>
<p>The ECMAScript Edition 5 standard will be the first update to be released in over four years. 
JavaScript 2.0 conforms to Edition 5 of the ECMAScript standard, and the difference between the two is extremely minor.</p>

<p>The specification for JavaScript 2.0 can be found on the following site: http://www.ecmascript.org/</p>

<p>Today, Netscape's JavaScript and Microsoft's JScript conform to the ECMAScript standard, 
although both the languages still support the features that are not a part of the standard.</p>




<h1><center>JavaScript - Syntax</center></h1>
<p>JavaScript can be implemented using JavaScript statements that are placed within the <script>... </script> HTML tags in a web page.</p>

<p>You can place the <script> tags, containing your JavaScript, anywhere within your web page, 
but it is normally recommended that you should keep it within the <head> tags.</p>

<p>The <script> tag alerts the browser program to start interpreting all the text between these tags as a script.
 A simple syntax of your JavaScript will appear as follows.</p>

<p><script ...>
   JavaScript code
</script></p>
<h1>The script tag takes two important attributes −</h1>

<b>Language − </b><p>This attribute specifies what scripting language you are using. Typically, its value will be javascript.
 Although recent versions of HTML (and XHTML, its successor) have phased out the use of this attribute.</p>

<b>Type − </b><p>This attribute is what is now recommended to indicate the scripting language in use and its value should be set to "text/javascript".</p>

<b>So your JavaScript segment will look like −</b>

<p>script language = <"javascript" type = "text/javascript">
   JavaScript code
script</p>


<h1>Your First JavaScript Code</h1>
<p>Let us take a sample example to print out "Hello World". We added an optional HTML comment that surrounds our JavaScript code.
 This is to save our code from a browser that does not support JavaScript.
 The comment ends with a "//-->". Here "//" signifies a comment in JavaScript, 
so we add that to prevent a browser from reading the end of the HTML comment as a piece of JavaScript code.
 Next, we call a function document.write which writes a string into our HTML document.</p>

<p>This function can be used to write text, HTML, or both. Take a look at the following code.</p>

<p>html</p>
   <p>body</p>   
      <p>script language = "javascript" type = "text/javascript"</p>
         <p>!--</p>
           <p> document.write("Hello World!")</p>
        <p> //--></p>
     <p> script </p>     
   <p>body</p>
<p>html</p>


<p>This code will produce the following result −</p>

<p>Hello World!</p>



<h1>Whitespace and Line Breaks</h1>
<p>JavaScript ignores spaces, tabs, and newlines that appear in JavaScript programs. 
You can use spaces, tabs, and newlines freely in your program and you are free to format and indent 
your programs in a neat and consistent way that makes the code easy to read and understand.</p>

<h1>Semicolons are Optional</h1>
<p>Simple statements in JavaScript are generally followed by a semicolon character, 
just as they are in C, C++, and Java. JavaScript, however, allows you to omit this semicolon if each of your 
statements are placed on a separate line. For example, the following code could be written without semicolons.</p>
