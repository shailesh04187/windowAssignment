<h1>HTML </h1>
<p>HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages.</p>

<h1>What is HTML?</h1>
<h1>1. Basics:</h1>
<p>• HTML is not a programming language. It is a markup language that tells browser
how to structure web pages.</p>
<p>• It Consists of series of elements which we use to enclose, wrap or markup
different parts of the contents to make it appear or act in certain way.</p>
<p>• HTML 5 is the latest evolution of the standard that defines HTML.</p>
<p>• HTML 5 define two different concepts:</p>
<p>a. It is a new version of the language with new elements and attributes.</p>
<p>b. A larger set of technologies that allows building more diverse and
powerful website and application.</p>

<h1>• Important features of HTML 5:</h1>
<p>a. Semantics: Allowing us to describe more precisely what our content is.</p>
<p>b. Multimedia: Incorporation of special element for audio and video embedding.</p>
<p>c. Device Access: Allowing for usage of various input and output devices.</p>
<p>d. Performance and Integration: Providing greater speed optimization and better</p>
usage of computer hardware.


<p>a. Opening Tag: This consists of name of the element. It marks where the
element begins.</p>
<p>b. Content: Information of the element.</p>
<p>c. Closing Tag: This marks end of the element and it precedes tag name with a
forward slash.</p>
<p>• So, an element in HTML is: Opening tag, followed by content, followed by closing
tag.</p>
<p>• Note-1: Content “Hello HTML!”, has a semantics/meaning now. What is it?</p>
<p>Note-2: HTML is case in-sensitive</p>


<h1>• Block-level Element:</h1>
<p>a. These elements are the structural element of HTML.</p>
<p>b. These forms the visible parts of the page. A block-level element appear in new
line following the content that precedes it.</p>
<p>c. Ex.: Heading, Paragraph, Lists, Navigation, Footer and so on.</p>
<p>d. Block-level elements can be nested within another block-level element but not
within a inline-element.</p>
<h1>• Inline Element:</h1>
<p>a. Inline Element are contained within block-level element and surrounds only small
parts of the document.</p>
<p>b. No new line after inline element in the document.</p>
<p>c. Ex. Include: <a>, <em>, <strong> and many more.</p>

<h1>• Empty Element:</h1>
<p>a. Not all elements follow the patterns of opening tag, content and closing tag.
Some elements only consists of single element, such element are called empty
element.</p>
<p>b. Ex. <img src=“imag.jpeg”></p>
<h1>• Attribute:</h1>
<p>a. Attribute contain extra information about the element that won’t appear in
the content.</p>
<p>b. In this ex. Class attribute is an identifying name used to target the element
with style or JavaScript information.</p>

<h1>• Boolean Attribute:</h1>
<p>a. Attribute written without values. They can have only one value, which is
generally the same as the attribute-name.</p>
<p>b. Ex. <input type=“text” disabled = “disabled”>
<input type=“text” disabled></p>
<p>[Note: Using disabled attribute prevents the end-user from entering text into
the input box.]</p>
<h1>• White Space in HTML:</h1>
<p>a. HTML parser reduce each sequence of white space to a single space, when
rendering the code.</p>
<p>b. However, proper space allows better readability of the code.</p>

<h1>• Entity Reference:</h1>
<p>a. Characters <,>,”,’, and & are special character. They are parts of the HTML
syntax.</p>
<p>b. Special codes called character reference/entity reference are used to render
special character.</p>
<p>c. Each reference starts with a ampersand(&) and ends with a semicolon(;).</p>
<p>Characters Character reference equivalent
< &lt;
> &gt;
“ &quot;
‘ &apos;
& &amp;</p>

<h1>• HTML Comments:</h1>
<p>a. The purpose of comments is to allow us to include notes in the code to explain
our logic.</p>
<p>b. Browser ignores comments.</p>
<h1>• <meta> element:</h1>
<p>a. Metadata is the data that describes data, and <meta> element achieves this.</p>
<p>b. ex. For specifying character set of the document:
<meta charset=“utf-8”></p>
<p>[Note-1: utf-8, Unicode Transformation Format – 8 bit.
(Universal Coded Character set).]</p>
<p>[Note-2: utf-8 is a variable-width character encoding used for electronic
communication.]</p>

<h1>• <meta> element:</h1>
<p>c. ex, adding author and description:
<p><meta name=“author” content=“Radhe ”>
<meta name=“description” content=“Basics of HTML.”></p>
<p>• Paragraph and Heading element: <p></p>, <h1><h2>…<h6></h6>…</h2></h1>.</p>
<p>a. Paragraphs are wrapped using <p></p> tag.</p>
<p>b. <h1> represents main heading, <h2> represents sub-heading, <h3> represents
sub-sub-heading and so on.</p>
<h1>• List Element:</h1>
<p>a. Un-ordered list: Un-ordered list are used to mark up lists of items for which
the order of the item doesn’t matter.</p>


<h1>• List Element:</h1>
<p>ex. <ul>
<li> Book.</li>
<li>Pen.</li>
</ul></p>
<h1>b. Ordered List:
 <p>.In ordered list, order of the item does matter.
 ex. <ol>
<li> Go straight.</li>
<li> Turn Left. </li>
</ol></p>

<h1>• List Element:</h1>
c. Description List:
<p>The propose of this list is to markup a set of item and their associated
descriptions, such as terms and definitions.</p>
<p>.It uses <dl> as a wrapper and in addition uses <dt> (description term)
element, and each description is wrapped in a <dd> (description definition)
element.</p>
<p>ex. <dl>
<dt>Computer Science.</dt>
<dd>Evolving.</dd>
</dl></p>
<p>Single term can have multiple description.</p>



<h1>• Emphasis element<em>:</h1>
<p> When we want to stress some words, there by subtly altering its meaning, we
use <em> element to that.</p>
<p> Browser style it as italics by default.</p>
<p>ex. <p> I am <em>glad</em> you weren’t <em>late</em></p>.</p>
<h1>• <strong> element:</h1>
<p>To give importance to certain words we use <strong> element.</p>
<p> By default browser renders it in bold.</p>
<h1>• Bold<b>, Italics<i>, and Underline<u>:</h1>
<p> Elements of HTML has associated semantics.</p>
<p> However, <b>,<i> and <u> only affect presentation and not semantics.</p>


<h1>• Bold<b>, Italics<i>, and Underline<u>:</h1>
<p> HTML 5, redefines <b>,<i>,<u> for semantic role.</p>
<p><b>: Meaning to be conveyed -> Keywords, Product Names…</p>
</p><i> : Meaning to be conveyed -> foreign words, taxonomic designation,
technical terms, a thought …</p>
<p><u>: Meaning to be conveyed -> Proper name, misspelling, …</p>
<h1>• Quotations:</h1>
<p> Either block-level or inline quotation are permissible in HTML.</p>
<p> Blockquotes:</p>
<p>Section of block-level content (be it paragraph, multiple paragraph, a list
etc.) is quoted from some where else.</p>
